# Cosc360Forums

360 project on making a forum like reddit.

## Proposal

### Details of team members (name, student number, and github username)

* Ethan Hsu 43371855 YuchenHsu
* Beth Ralston 18799312 mblackbeak
* Jacob Tizel 75492660 jacobtizel

### Project description and details:

### Use snake case for all variables, file names, and github branches (everything!)

#### Provide a description of the project you are going to undertake

* MyDiscussionForum Website: The MyDiscussionForum website will allow registered users to engage in online discussions and unregistered users to view discussions similar to forums such as Reddit. The goal is to produce a similar type service that allows users to register, post stories and make comments on items.   Additionally, unregistered users must be able to search and view the content but will not be able to edit or comment on posts. Registered users should be able to leave comments/feedback. Functionality must exist for searching/categorizing items.

#### Requirements list of what (at a minimum) your site will do (you will need to explore existing sites to understand their functional offerings). You should be able to understand from reading this document exactly what a user/administrator will be able to do on the site.  You will receive feedback on this so that you can direct the efforts of your project accordingly.
