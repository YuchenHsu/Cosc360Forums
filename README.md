# Cosc360Forums

360 project on making a forum like reddit.

## Proposal

* Details of team members (name and student number)
* Project description and details:
  * Provide a description of the project you are going to undertake
  * Requirements list of what (at a minimum) your site will do (you will need to explore existing sites to understand their functional offerings). You should be able to understand from reading this document exactly what a user/administrator will be able to do on the site.  You will receive feedback on this so that you can direct the efforts of your project accordingly.
  * This will form a list of minimum end deliverables on the project and should be a comprehensive document.
  * You can submit this as a readme-type document on Canvas.
  * Early review is encouraged for feedback.
